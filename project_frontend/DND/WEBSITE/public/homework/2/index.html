  <h1>Project 2: Fonts</h1>
  <h2>Font Stacking</h2>
  <p>
    Font stacking is a technique which is commonly used due to the fact
    that it is both cheap and easy to use. Basically, several fonts are chosen
    to be "stacked" on top of each other, and the browser will chose from the
    top of the stack and work its way down, depending on availability.
    For example, the first font in the stack is to be selected. If this font
    is unavailable, the first font is discarded and the next font in the stack
    will be selected instead. This method ensures there is always atleast one
    usable font chosen by the creator.

  <h2>Self-Hosting</h2>
    <p>
      This method allows a user to upload their own font data and serve it
      through their website. While this may increase freedom, generally this
      method is frowned upon because it is not as reliable as other methods.
      Multiple files of different formats must be employed, and the font has
      to be test to ensure that it will properly display on a variety of
      different screens.

      <p>1. To self-host a font, you must first download the files which
        contain the font itself. This contains the actual font, which allows
        the computer to present type in a given format.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Next, you must create a web font from the font. This web font allows
        the website to present a single format to a variety of different browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Finally, you can specify the font family and type in the site's CSS
        file. It is easy to apply this font to your website once this is done.
