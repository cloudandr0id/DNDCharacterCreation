    <h1>Races</h1>

    <h3>Dwarves:</h3>
        <p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of
            mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and
            blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning
            hatred of goblins and orcs – these common threads unite all dwarves.</p>
        <p>Alignment: Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits
            of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a
            strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to
            share in the benefits of a just order.</p>
        <p>Size: Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150
            pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
        <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 25 feet. Speed is not reduced by wearing
            heavy armor.</p>
        <p>Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision
            in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet
            of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
            light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
        <p>Dwarven Resilience: You have advantage on saving throws against poison,
            and you have resistance against poison damage.</p>
        <p>Dwarven Combat Training: You have proficiency with the battleaxe,
            handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.</p>
        <p>Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of
            your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.</p>
        <p>Stonecunning: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check
            related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient
            in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the
            check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.</p>
        <p>Languages: Common and Dwarvish.</p>
        <p>Ability Score Increase: Constitution score increases by 2.</p>

    <h3>Elves:</h3>
        <p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common
            races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison
            to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter
            lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they
            are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder
            races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation
            of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators,
            the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p>
        <p>Alignment: Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they
            lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and
            protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more
            often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark
            has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>
        <p>Size: Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.
             Your size is Medium.</p>
        <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
        <p>Darkvision: Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, elves have
            superior vision in dark and dim conditions. They can see in dim light
             within 60 feet of them as if it were bright light, and in darkness
             as if it were dim light. Elves can't discern color in darkness, only
             shades of gray.</p>
        <p>Fey Ancestry: Elves have advantage on saving throws against being
            charmed, and magic can't be put to sleep.</p>
        <p>Languages: Common and Elven.</p>
        <p>Ability Score Increase: Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>

    <h3>Half-Elves:</h3>
        <p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves
            combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human
            parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the
            refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.</p>
        <p>Alignment: Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage.
            They both value personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating
            neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules,
            resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least
            unpredictable. They are good and evil in equal numbers, a trait they
            share with their human parents.</p>
        <p>Size: Half-Elves are more or less the same size as humans, ranging
            from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
        <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
        <p>Darkvision: Thanks to your elven heritage, you have superior vision
            in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet
            of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim
            light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
        <p>Languages: Common and Elven.</p>
        <p>Ability Score Increase: Charisma score increases by 2, and two
            other ability scores of your choice each increase by 1.</p>
        <p>Half-Elf Versatility: Choose one of the following traits- </p>
            <ul>
                <li>General Heritage:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skill Versatility: Gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Dark Elf Heritage:</li>
                    <ul>

                            reach 5th level, you can cast Darkness once, and it
                            recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting
                            ability for these spells.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>High Elf Heritage:</li>

                            the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your
                            spellcasting ability for it.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Wood Elf Heritage: </li>

                            35 feet.</li>
                        <li>Mask of the Wild. You can attempt to hide even when
                            you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain,
                            falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

   <h3>Half-Orcs:</h3>
        <p>When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs
                are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes,
                their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc
                rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans
                and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers,
                achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their
                barbaric customs and savage fury.</p>
        <p>Alignment: Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc
                parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised
                among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually
                evil.</p>
        <p>Size: Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they
                range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
        <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
        <p>Darkvision: Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark
                and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as
                if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
                can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
        <p>Menacing: Gained proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
        <p>Relentless Endurance: When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not
                killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use
                this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
        <p>Savage Attacks: When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon
                attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional
                time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>
        <p>Languages: Common and Orc</p>
        <p>Ability Score Increase: Strength score increases by 2, and Constitution
                score increases by 1.</p>

    <h3>Halfings:</h3>
        <p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place
            to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing
            armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the
            open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands
            and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal
            to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display
            remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are
            threatened.</p>
        <p>Alignment: Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are
            good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no
            tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional,
            leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of
            the old ways.</p>
        <p>Size: Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds.
            Your size is small.</p>
        <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
        <p>Lucky: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving
            throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if
            it is a 1.</p>
        <p>Brave: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
        <p>Nimble: You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size
            larger than yours.</p>
        <p>Languages: Common and Halfling.</p>
        <p>Ability Score Increase: Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>

    <h3>Humans:</h3>
        <p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common
            races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison
            to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter
            lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they
            are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder
            races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation
            of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators,
            the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p>
        <p>Alignment: Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the
            worst are found among them.</p>
        <p>Size: Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well
            over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size
            is Medium.</p>
        <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
        <p>Languages: Common and one extra language of your choice.</p>
        <p>Ability Score Increase: Ability scores each increase by 1.</p>

    <h3>Tiefling:</h3>
       <p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on
        the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of
        the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is
        because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus,
        overlord of the Nine Hells (and many of the other powerful devils serving
        under him) into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not
        their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their
        children and their children's children will always be held accountable.</p>
       <p>Alignment: Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but
        many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines
        many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.</p>
       <p>Size: Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is
        Medium.</p>
       <p>Speed: Base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
       <p>Darkvision: Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in
        dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you
        as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
        can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
       <p>Hellish Resistance: You have resistance to fire damage.</p>
       <p>Languages: Common and Infernal.</p>
       <p>Ability Score Increase: Charisma score increases by 2.</p>
