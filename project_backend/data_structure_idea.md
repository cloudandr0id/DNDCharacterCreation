1. Based on the high level of data structures needed (due to all the different
  types of classes, races, enchanted items, and other stat modifying items or
  feats), there should be a class dedicated alone to retrieving any desired
  stat modifiers.
  *The method of organizing data needs to be further discussed.*
2. There should be a single class for interacting with the JavaScript/HTML/CSS
  website. JSON should be imported and heavily utilized.
  *Research will need to be done concerning the conversion of our code's*
  *calculations and data retrievals to frontend's programs*
3. In between the data structure class and frontend interaction class should be
  multiple classes, each concerned with a different aspect of the character
  sheet.
  *We will need to illustrate and elaborate on what classes (with attributes*
  *and operators) are needed and how they need to interact with one another*
