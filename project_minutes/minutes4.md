Adding “Character Constructor” or something similar to it.
Something like “D&D Character Constructor”
“DDCC for short”

Web Service:
Must have this done sooner than later.
What are we using?
AWS Amazon?
Namecheap/hostwinds from CS212
Idea is to use Grace’s website and change domains for this project
Domain idea is having a domain ending with “.xyz” for cheap
Make everyone co-owners of the website to access it

Idea for software on the website:
Ari and Hannah are wanting to work on the software of the website/project
Grace wants to work on the website CSS and JS

3 - 3 for Website and Project ( Can change if software needs more help)

Website: Jon, Grace, and Skyler
Software: Ari, Hannah, and Richard

1:20: Hello World Page
Back Burner and will need to work on it and figure out how to put it on the page.

Django: Can allow people to make the software to make the app. Add functionality to the website.
Consolidation of tools: Git/Github, Atom

How to link Python to JS?
Website that allows us to connect JS and Python using a hello world page. Using JSON.
How to set up a web server too!

Assume that the website can be used with this.
Smart if we all do this/look into this.
Helps send stuff to/from the sides of the project.

1:30: Basic Text Sheet Mock Up
What is it?
Its the basic Character sheet and how it would look on the page.

Figuring out how the page should look like.

Discord Text Channels for Project and Website


1:32: Checklist on Trello
Github Repos. Done

Software Team: Figuring out how the data could be stored. Responsible for having all the data stored. Determine what classes we want and how to structure that. Libraries we need.Obviously we need JSON. Look up common python libraries for websites.

Draft up: Storing default data of character sheet. How to store save data. Classes, Methods and functions.

Website Team: Getting a Hello World for now. Figuring out how to make this hello world before programming the real project.

1:37: Checkup:
Everyone got github, atom, and all the required stuff in software.

1:40: Deliverables:
Hannah got the first part of the github done. Will reconfigure the font size to be like the example. Will look into basic syntax of GitHub to make it look like the example.

Part 3: Has everyone found their 1-2 people to interview.
The sooner we can get these done, the better.

Part 2 and 4:
Part 2: Someone will have to guess the Initial value proposition and consumer segments (Jon Nation)
Part 4: Summaries Part 1 - Part 3. (Ari)

Idea to make separate channels for both sides of the project. We will split up figuring out what needs to be done.
