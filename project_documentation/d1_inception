1. Introduction

"Dungeons and Dragons" or DnD is a fantasy, tabletop role-playing game
that brings people together to participate in a continuous campaign.
Guided by the Dungeon Master, players battle monsters and complete quests until
the end of the campaign. Character creation is one of the defining parts of DnD.
Yet more often than not, new players are overwhelmed with the process of
character creation; "DnD Character Creation" is an application designed to lead
any player, new or old, through the process of character creation. Users design
their character in four main sequential steps: selecting class and race,
rolling for their base stats, choosing their proficiencies and items, and
customizing their character with appearance, backstory, etc. Future work may
include support for character leveling, design recommendations based on previous
selections, a saving system with unique keys, and automatic character sheet GUI
for completed character creations.
