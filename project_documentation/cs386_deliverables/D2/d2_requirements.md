<h2>1. Positioning</h2>
<h3>1.1 Problem Statement</h3>
The problem of complicated and inefficient character sheets affects D&D players,
gamers, college students, and role players, the impact of which is less time
spent playing Dungeons and Dragons, and more time spent managing and keeping
track of complex information.

<h3>1.2 Product Position Statement</h3>
For D&D players and Gamers who have multiple Dungeons and Dragons character
sheets, D&D Character Creator is a planning and organization site that allows
players to easily keep track of, manage, view, and change their characters.

and more time playing the game.

<h3>1.3 Value Proposition and Consumer Segment</h3>
D&D Character Creator is an easy to use character creation sheet that allows
D&D players and role players to more efficiently organize their character sheets,
without an overly-busy UI and restricted features commonly found in other
similar products.
