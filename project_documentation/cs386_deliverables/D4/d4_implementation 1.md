# 1. Introduction
The DND Character Constructor is an online utility for the game Dungeons and Dragons, designed
to accommodate user-created characters in a simplistic website. Users create an account and
have access to a character creation program that automates complicated calculations and offers
an easily accessible database of character races, classes, and other necessary details.

The DND Character Constructor is still early in development, but its alpha release allows for
account creation and basic character creation. The website has a simple graphic user interface,
featuring headers for easy navigation and pages for each necessary site. Soon, these pages will
contain more logic to better build DND characters. Already, the alpha site has the functionality
and simplicity that users desire.

# 3. Adopted Technologies
**Hostwinds:**
Hostwinds is a service that allows customers to host their own websites. We used this to host our website because some team members have used this service before in a previous class.

**WinSCP/FileZilla:**
WinSCP and FileZilla are both file transfer protocols that are used to deposit and
update the website's files. Both FTP tools are simple to use, offering an intuitive
user interface. Each member is allowed to use either WinSCP or FileZilla, since
they both offer the same services and connection to the website.

**HTML and CSS:**
Two vital languages in order to have a nice formated website. HTML can be used to 
create the basic website layout while CSS makes the website looks visually appealing.
We needed to use these languages in order to get a user interface for our website.

**PHP:**
PHP is a general scripting language that is best used for web development. We choose to use this because it'll allow us to make our website more dynamic.

**SQL:**
SQL is a language that is used for managing data held in a database system. Our team choose to use this because it is the best language to use for managing data in a database system.

# 5. Deployment
The product is being hosted [here](http://hwsrv-766227.hostwindsdns.com).

# 6. Licensing
[MIT License](https://github.com/cloudandr0id/DNDCharacterCreation/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

We have chosen the MIT license because we want to allow people to customize our program for
their own Dungeons and Dragons needs in closed source versions. By having the MIT license,
our program is accessible to anyone.

# 8. Look & Feel
We want our site to mimic the look and feel of a real D&D character sheet. To achieve this,
the finished sheet is arranged in a layout similar to that of a real one. Additionally,
we use natural colors to evoke a medieval aesthetic. Our goal is for players to be taken out
of the roleplaying experience as little as possible while using our site.

# 9. Lessons Learned
The exploration of tools and methods of hosting took a lot more time and energy than expected.
Because of the initial difficulties in finding the correct tools for our project, our first
release is minimal. However, we anticipate that the next development cycle will run more
smoothly because we now have our technological foundation. Each member participated a satisfactory amount,
but Ari Jaramillo and Grace Hsieh especially pulled through in organizing our group and devoting
the time to problem-solve our technological issues.
