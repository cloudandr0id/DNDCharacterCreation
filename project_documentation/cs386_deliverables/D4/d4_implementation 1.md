# 1. Introduction
The DND Character Constructor is an online utility for the game Dungeons and Dragons, designed
to accommodate user-created characters in a simplistic website. Users create an account and
have access to a character creation program that automates complicated calculations and offers
an easily accessible database of character races, classes, and other necessary details.

The DND Character Constructor is still early in development, but its alpha release allows for
account creation and basic character creation. The website has a simple graphic user interface,
featuring headers for easy navigation and pages for each necessary site. Soon, these pages will
contain more logic to better build DND characters. Already, the alpha site has the functionality
and simplicity that users desire.

# 2. Implemented Requirements
  1. "As a D&D Player I want to create an account so that I can store all my
      characters I create into a safe place so that I do not lose them in a pile of papers."
      Priority: Medium
      Estimated Hours: 1.5

# 3. Adopted Technologies
**Hostwinds:**
Hostwinds. Some members on the team have used this before to host a website.

**WinSCP/FileZilla:**
WinSCP, FileZilla, and others. This is the best software to transfer files to the server.

# 6. Licensing
[MIT License](https://github.com/cloudandr0id/DNDCharacterCreation/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

# 8. Look & Feel
We want our site to mimic the look and feel of a real D&D character sheet. To achieve this,
the finished sheet is arranged in a layout similar to that of a real one. Additionally,
we use natural colors to evoke a medieval aesthetic. Our goal is for players to be taken out
of the roleplaying experience as little as possible while using our site.

# 9. Lessons Learned
The exploration of tools and methods of hosting took a lot more time and energy than expected.
Because of the initial difficulties in finding the correct tools for our project, our first
release is minimal. However, we anticipate that the next development cycle will run more
smoothly because we now have our technological foundation. Each member participated a satisfactory amount,
but Ari Jaramillo and Grace Hsieh especially pulled through in organizing our group and devoting
the time to problem-solve our technological issues.
