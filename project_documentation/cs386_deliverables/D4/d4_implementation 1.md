# 1. Introduction
The DND Character Constructor is an online utility for the game Dungeons and Dragons, designed
to accommodate user-created characters in a simplistic website. Users create an account and
have access to a character creation program that automates complicated calculations and offers
an easily accessible database of character races, classes, and other necessary details.

# 8. Look & Feel
We want our site to mimic the look and feel of a real D&D character sheet. To achieve this, 
the finished sheet is arranged in a layout similar to that of a real one. Additionally, 
we use natural colors to evoke a medieval aesthetic. Our goal is for players to be taken out 
of the roleplaying experience as little as possible while using our site.
