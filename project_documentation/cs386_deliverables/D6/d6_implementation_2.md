# 1. Introduction
The DND Character Constructor is an online utility for the game Dungeons and Dragons, designed to accommodate user-created characters in a simplistic website. Users create an account and have access to a character creation program that automates complicated calculations and offers an easily accessible database of character races, classes, and other necessary details.

# 4. Code Quality
Code quality was implemented primarily in the form of general guidelines for readability
and human understanding. For instance, the brackets used for defining classes/functions/loops
had to own their own lines. Otherwise, differentiating between each body of code would be
more difficult. Another example is the banning of one-letter or undescriptive variables,
as well as having these variables in camel case. All of these guidelines are written onto
a devoted text channel on the team Discord server, managed and enforced by the quality
assurance team member.
