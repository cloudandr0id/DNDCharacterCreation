# 1. Introduction
The DND Character Constructor is an online utility for the game Dungeons and Dragons, designed to accommodate user-created characters in a simplistic website. Users create an account and have access to a character creation program that automates complicated calculations and offers an easily accessible database of character races, classes, and other necessary details.

# 2. Implemented Requirements

1. We implemented a guide for new and old D&D Players to look at when creating a character. This allows players to view all kinds of races, classes, and equipment that they can use.  
Trello:   https://trello.com/c/GL3UvSm6/18-guide-with-info-about-various-things  
Hannah and Ari started the implementation of this guide and finished it together.  
Hannah reviewed and pushed the guide into the main  

2. The team also implemented a way to update the level of a character and edit the character that the player has created.

Skyler has implemented this updating feature of the character creator.  
Skyler has reviewed and pushed the feature into the main

# 4. Code Quality
Code quality was implemented primarily in the form of general guidelines for readability
and human understanding. For instance, the brackets used for defining classes/functions/loops
had to own their own lines. Otherwise, differentiating between each body of code would be
more difficult. Another example is the banning of one-letter or undescriptive variables,
as well as having these variables in camel case. All of these guidelines are written onto
a devoted text channel on the team Discord server, managed and enforced by the quality
assurance team member.
