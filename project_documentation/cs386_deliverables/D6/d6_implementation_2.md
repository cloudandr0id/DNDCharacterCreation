# 1. Introduction
The DND Character Constructor is an online utility for the game Dungeons and Dragons, designed to accommodate user-created characters in a simplistic website. Users create an account and have access to a character creation program that automates complicated calculations and offers an easily accessible database of character races, classes, and other necessary details.

# 2. Implemented Requirements

1. We implemented a guide for new and old D&D Players to look at when creating a character. This allows players to view all kinds of races, classes, and equipment that they can use.

Hannah and Ari started the implementation of this guide and finished it together.  
Hannah reviewed and pushed the guide into the main  

2. The team also implemented a way to update the level of a character and edit the character that the player has created.

Skyler has implemented this updating feature of the character creator.

# 4. Code Quality
Code quality was implemented primarily in the form of general guidelines for readability
and human understanding. For instance, the brackets used for defining classes/functions/loops
had to own their own lines. Otherwise, differentiating between each body of code would be
more difficult. Another example is the banning of one-letter or undescriptive variables,
as well as having these variables in camel case. All of these guidelines are written onto
a devoted text channel on the team Discord server, managed and enforced by the quality
assurance team member.

# 5. Lessons Learned
During the second release, our team learned a lot of things. To start, one of the biggest takeaways from this iteration of the project is the importance of proper organization and planning. While we were able to complete the project, it is our belief that it would have been completed much more efficiently and effectively had we been more focused on planning in the early stages of the project, instead of slowly ramping up over the course of weeks as we did. Furthermore, the organizational structure of our team was always in a state of flux, which hindered our ability to act cohesively and decisively.

Another key lesson which was learned in this process is the importance of understanding key technologies. Our group was delayed several weeks due to the time spent deciding on and implementing specific technologies and infrastructure which was necessary to complete the project. If this project were to be done again, our group would have been much more vigilant on selecting and implementing the most important technologies first, as well as testing and ensuring that quality standards were met to the highest possible degree.
