# System Description
In the D&D World, there is an inefficient design to the Character Sheet that gives new and old players a hard time. The D&D Character Creator is a planning and organization site that allows players to maintain their characters unlike D&D Beyond. This product will provide functionality and simplicity to players who want to play the game instead of keeping track of their character sheet. D&D Character Creator is an easy to use creation tool that allows players to organize their character sheets without an overly-busy UI and restricted features found in similar products.

Functional requirements of this system are personalization, access to information, ease of use and continuity.

Personalization in a *character sheet* is specific to each **user**. There should be a choice to either create a *character sheet* from scratch or for the computer to generate one for them. Aspects within the *character sheet* will be given further room to change after initial creation with the implementation of changeable <u>attributes that pertain to Dungeons and Dragons</u>. Without these features, the editability and appeal of paper and pen during a game of Dungeons and Dragons is rendered useless and the product will end up being a character ‘printer’ instead of a user’s character sheet.
