# System Description
In the game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), the character sheet are filled with inefficient designs that gives both new and old players a hard time.
The D&D Character Creator is a planning and organization site that allows players to maintain their characters.
This product will provide functionality and simplicity to players who want to play the game instead of becoming overwhelmed by their
character sheet. D&D Character Creator is an easy to use creation tool that allows players to organize their character sheets without
an overly-busy UI and restricted features found in similar products.

Functional requirements of this system are personalization, access to information, ease of use and continuity.

Personalization in a *character sheet* is specific to each **user**. There should be a choice to create a *character sheet*
from scratch with or without system recommendations. Aspects within the *character sheet* will be given further room to change
after initial creation with the implementation of changeable <ins>attributes that pertain to Dungeons and Dragons</ins>. Without these
features, the editability and appeal of paper and pen during a game of Dungeons and Dragons is rendered useless and the product will end
up being a character ‘printer’ instead of a **user**’s character sheet.

Access to information is available when the **user** is creating their character on the character sheet. When choosing a race or class the
system will provide some recommendations for what you could build. The **user** will also be able to get information on <ins>Spells and Features
that are in the Dungeons and Dragons’ Player Handbook</ins> to put into their *character sheet*. Without this feature, the player would be looking
through the D&D Player’s Handbook for features and spells that they would want to use for their campaign. The **admin** will be able to look
at the account list to see who has created an account and what their <ins>account information</ins> is.

Ease of use is important to both the **admin** and the **user**. Being able to access <ins>account information</ins> from servers is only one aspect.
The editing, viewing, and processing of information on the *character sheet* needs to be both new player friendly and intuitive in order
to fulfill needs of stakeholders. It is inconvenient for a software made for viewing and editing details that needs to be done in the heat
of a game to be slow, inconsistent, or inoperable.

Stakeholders expressed an extreme interest in continuity. Being able to move from computer to phone or laptop was emphasized as the most important
part and the advantage of using a digitized *character sheet* over pen and paper while playing Dungeons and Dragons. With an account system, the **user**
will have access to saving their *character sheets* and retrieving the information that they save if the **user** wants to go back to a past *character sheet*.
This product would not be usable if the **user** cannot save their information and have to restart their progress every time the user has a session.

All of the non-functional requirements can be seen throughout the program. Using these as the baseline for production will ensure that all shareholder interests are met and a successful product will have been created.
