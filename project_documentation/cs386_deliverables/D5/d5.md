# 1. Description
For those wishing to get involved in Dungeons & Dragons, the complexity behind
developing a character often intimidates them away due to its confusing, unintuitive
design. Even experienced players have to deal with inefficiencies in the creation
process. DND Character Constructor is an online, Dungeons & Dragons character creation
platform that seeks to simplify the character creation process.
Our server will hold users' accounts and saved characters. It will also store
relevant information for user searches concerning character attributes, such as
classes and races. Our provided algorithms will automate calculations (including
dice rolls and running totals for proficiencies/stat bonuses) and suggest potential
settings depending on what the user has selected. Finally, DND Character Constructor
will offer an exportation function that allows users to share and download their
characters.
