# 1. Description
For those wishing to get involved in Dungeons & Dragons, the complexity behind
developing a character often intimidates them away due to its confusing, unintuitive
design. Even experienced players have to deal with inefficiencies in the creation
process. DND Character Constructor is an online, Dungeons & Dragons character creation
platform that seeks to simplify the character creation process.
Our server will hold users' accounts and saved characters. It will also store
relevant information for user searches concerning character attributes, such as
classes and races. Our provided algorithms will automate calculations (including
dice rolls and running totals for proficiencies/stat bonuses) and suggest potential
settings depending on what the user has selected. Finally, DND Character Constructor
will offer an exportation function that allows users to share and download their
characters.

# 2. Architecture
![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudandr0id/DNDCharacterCreation/main/project_documentation/cs386_deliverables/D5/d5_architecture_diagram.PNG)
This explanation describes our entire project. All of our decisions up until now have followed the structure of how a person would normally create a DND Character.
There needed to be a UI to view the sheet, processing to manipulate the sheet, and somewhere to store it all.

**User Case:** Modify Account Information

**Actor:** User

**Description:** Modify a user’s account to what they want to be changed.

**Precondition:** User has made an account and contacted User for modifying their account.

**Postcondition:** User modifies account to what the user wants to modify.

**Main Flow:**

    1. User makes account and makes a mistake in their account making.

    2. User contacts User to help them modify their account.

    3. User goes into the system and modifies account to what the User has asked them to fix.

**Alternative Flow(s):**

    1. User makes account and makes no mistake in their account making.

    2. User doesn’t need to contact User and is happy!

# 6. Design Principles

**Single Responsibilty principle**: Our Class class only holds information such as trait ID, title, description,
and required level and it's only responsibilty is sharing that information with the Character class.

**Open/closed Principle**: Our Race class follows this principle because when the user first makes their character,
they choose a race but after that they cannot change the race of their character.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**: We are unsure if we have a class that uses this principle.

**Interface Segregation Principle**: In our class diagram, we do not have our interfaces included but we do have
different interfaces based on what needs to be done. For example, there is a separate interface for login into your account and creating your character.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**: Our Character class follows this principle when users change their character.
Using this principles allows the user to simple make changes to certain parts of their character and not worry about
the rest such as stats being reconfigured based on level change.
