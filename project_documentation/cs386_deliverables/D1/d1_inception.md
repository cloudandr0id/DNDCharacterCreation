### Group 01 - DnD Character Constructor
### Date: February 15th 2021
#### Group Members: Grace Hsieh, Jonathan Nation, Hannah Trenary, Richard McCormick,
#### Ari Jaramillo, Skyler Hanson


#### **1. Introduction**

"Dungeons and Dragons" or DnD is a fantasy, tabletop role-playing game
that brings people together to participate in a continuous campaign.
Guided by the Dungeon Master, players battle monsters and complete quests until
the end of the campaign. Character creation is one of the defining parts of DnD.
Yet more often than not, new players are overwhelmed with the process of
character creation; "DnD Character Creation" is an application designed to lead
any player, new or old, through the process of character creation. Users design
their character in four main sequential steps: selecting class and race,
rolling for their base stats, choosing their proficiencies and items, and
customizing their character with appearance, backstory, etc. Future work may
include support for character leveling, design recommendations based on previous
selections, a saving system with unique keys, and automatic character sheet GUI
for completed character creations.

#### **2. Initial  value  proposition  and  consumer  segments**
  What guess that should be in the application.:
    - Save input of rolled dice
    - Easy Access to character sheets
    - Some character suggestions to players
    - Input field for skills and stats
    - Information class that has all the information of the classes and races.
    - Having either a link for other characters or store all of them for when people want to gather them again.
    - Putting some parts of the character sheets like spells closer to the top page than being the back page.

  **IVP:** Will help players keep track of their characters and help make their future characters.
  D&D Character Creator is a free application that allows users to create and customize their own character sheets, and to save and access this information when and wherever they like.

  **Initial Consumer Segments:**
    - All Levels of D&D Players (Beginner to Master)
    - Gamers
    - College Students
    - Tech consumers
    - Roleplayers
